This project is coded in Python and the program should run on Python3 based on Linux OS some libraries don't work on Mac Os and Windows
When running the program it may need to be configured as an executable script which we can do by only running this command on terminal "Chmod +x Packet_Sniffer.py"
For running properly the script should run with the sudo command
